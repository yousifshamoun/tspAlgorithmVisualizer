# TSP Algorithms Visualizer

Find the estimated optimal path that visits multiple cities and returns using heuristic algorithms developed for the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) 

All algorithms run in the browser and results are saved in state using Redux

Tweak the parameters and experiment to see how each algorithm functions!
